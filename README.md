# Music-Charts-Transcriptions

Hello!

These are various compositions, transcriptions and arrangements I've made. I'm posting them here so others can make use of them, or use them as a starting point for projects of their own.

Most of the pieces are in MuseScore's .mcsz format. You can download MuseScore for free at https://musescore.org/ . 

In using the charts/scores/pieces, my request is simply that you drop me a note/comment to let me know that you're using them. That way I know if this work is really benefitting others! :D

All my best,
Justin
